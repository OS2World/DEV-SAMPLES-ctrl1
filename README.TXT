 The sample source code this month can be used with the new IBM
 Universal Resource Editor (URE).  The control can be utilized within
 a window or dialogue similar to standard PM controls except that it uses
 the PMCX interface to interact with URE.  Because of this, we have not
 provided a driver to show the control and its usage.  Instead, we will
 use URE as the driver.


 Enjoy!
